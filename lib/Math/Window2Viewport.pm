=head1 NAME

Math::Window2Viewport - Just another window to viewport mapper.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Math::Window2Viewport;

  my $mapper = Math::Window2Viewport->new(
      Wb => 0, Wt => 1, Wl => 0, Wr => 1,
      Vb => 9, Vt => 0, Vl => 0, Vr => 9,
  );

  my ($x, $y) = (0.5, 0.6);
  my $x2 = int( $mapper->Dx( $x ) );
  my $y2 = int( $mapper->Dy( $y ) );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module will convert one set of coordinates (the World Window)
into another set (the Viewport) for the purposes of graphing any
set of points from one system to another.

=head1 EXAMPLE

The following will generate a Fourier synthesized
square wave via L<GD::Simple>:

  use GD::Simple;
  use Math::Window2Viewport;

  my ($width, $height, $res) = (500, 300, .02);
  my $img = GD::Simple->new( $width, $height );
  my $mapper = Math::Window2Viewport->new(
      Wb => -1, Wt => 1, Wl => -1, Wr => 1,
      Vb => $height, Vt => 0, Vl => 0, Vr => $width,
  );

  my (%curr,%prev);
  for (my $x = -1; $x <= 1; $x += $res) {
      my $y = 0;
      for (my $i = 1; $i < 20; $i += 2) {
          $y += 1 / $i * cos( 2 * 3.1459 * $i * $x + ( -3.1459 / 2 ) );
      }
      %curr = ( dx => $mapper->Dx( $x ), dy => $mapper->Dy( $y ) );
      $img->moveTo( @prev{qw(dx dy)} );
      $img->lineTo( @curr{qw(dx dy)} );
      %prev = %curr;
  }

  print $img->png;

Try changing the value for C<$res>. See the example
directory for more.
